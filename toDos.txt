# Emergency Admin Withdrawals
When only withdrawals are allowed. Add a time interval after which the owner can withdraw all the funds without interacting with the oracle.
This is to save the TVL if the oracle is buggy and reverts.

# Optimizations
Minimize # hot SLOADs

# Periphery
- Add quoting functions
- Add getReserves function

# Core
- Do not distribute SIR to POL. Easy to hack without extra gas in the current implementation because totalSupply and vaultBalance share the same slot.
- Code Staker which is allowed to withdraw fees. Staker inherits SIR?
